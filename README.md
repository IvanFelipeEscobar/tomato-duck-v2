## Description

Tomato Duck is a dynamic productivity platform inspired by the principles of PromoFocus. At its core, Tomato Duck empowers users to enhance their focus and productivity through the innovative combination of a TomatoTimer and a supportive rubber duck chat bot.

The TomatoTimer, reminiscent of the Pomodoro Technique, is a key feature of Tomato Duck, aiding users in efficiently managing their time by breaking work into manageable intervals interspersed with short breaks. This proven method helps users maintain focus and combat distractions, resulting in increased productivity and task completion.

Complementing the TomatoTimer is Tomato Duck's unique rubber duck chat bot, powered by ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo. This virtual companion provides users with a conversational space to articulate their thoughts, brainstorm ideas, and overcome obstacles. Whether users need a sounding board for problem-solving or simply crave companionship during work sessions, the rubber duck chat bot is always ready to lend an ear and offer guidance.

Tomato Duck's frontend is crafted using React with Vite, employing TypeScript for robust type checking and Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI for a modern and visually appealing user interface. Zustand is utilized for efficient state management, facilitating seamless integration of authentication and task list management functionalities.

Hosted on Vercel, Tomato Duck ensures lightning-fast performance and reliability for users, while carefully managing resources to optimize costs. The backend, powered by a Node.js Express server hosted on Render, handles user authentication securely using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) passed within HTML-only cookies. Nodemailer is integrated to deliver verification and password reset emails, with stylish email templates designed using Handlebars.js.

Additionally, the backend serves as the endpoint for the chat bot, seamlessly connecting with the frontend to provide users with a cohesive and immersive experience. With its blend of proven productivity techniques, innovative features, and meticulous attention to detail, Tomato Duck is poised to become the ultimate companion for individuals striving to maximize their productivity and achieve their goals effectively.
